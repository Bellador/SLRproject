\section{Appendix: Search terms}\label{appendix_search_terms}

The following list contains the search terms used to query the scientific databases (e.g. Scopus) for matching publications. Search terms for which our research group did not possess the necessary competences were neglected, particularly in the field of diseases and substance misuse. On the other hand, missing but from our perspective relevant search terms regarding human well-being were added:

1. (outdoor OR nature) AND recreation (SDG3)
2. work AND life AND balance (SDG3)
3. mental health (?) - no, too many returns (2592)
4. (landscape OR urban*) AND (green* OR plan*) (SDG11) -> integrated in: (green* OR urban* OR rural* OR region* OR landscape) AND (develop* OR plan* OR development plan)
